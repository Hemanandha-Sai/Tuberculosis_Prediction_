# Tuberculosis_Prediction_

# 🩺 Tuberculosis Prediction from Chest X-rays

A deep learning project to classify chest X-ray images as **TB-positive** or **normal**, using a Convolutional Neural Network built with TensorFlow/Keras.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project uses a CNN to analyze chest X-ray images and predict tuberculosis infection. The model is trained and evaluated on a publicly available dataset with labeled TB and normal cases.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🏥 Binary classification: TB vs Normal
- 🧠 CNN architecture built with Keras/TensorFlow
- 📈 Training and validation accuracy/loss tracking
- 🔄 Implements preprocessing and data augmentation techniques
